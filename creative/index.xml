      <description>Don’t look into the sun
They tell you as a child
But it’s so hard not to
When consequences seem mild
I stare up at through the oak tree
A fluttering filter to the sky
Every once in a while a leaf moves
And then sun burns my eyes
I do not panic
I do not look away
For in less than a second
a leaf guards my gaze
What’s left is a pulsing blue dot</description>

      <description>Are your virtual experiences
creating simulated realities?
 Could you tell them apart from actuality?
 Are your virtual realities
creating simulated experiences?
 And if that is the case,
when does it become deleterious ?
 Could you explain, to me, the difference?
 I think the line is blurring for me.
I think the line is blurring me.

      <description>Tell me why you like blue eyes.
When you stare, who do you see?
Because when you look into my eyes.
I know you&amp;rsquo;re not looking at me.

 To be fair, I like brown eyes.
For reasons assumed the same.
Because when I look into your eyes,
All I can think of is their name.

      <title>My Tiny Record Player</title>

      <description>Background All my friends have record players- their homes are full of warm analog music and dusty wooden crates full of vinyl records. I love the ritual of sifting through the fraying sleeves, gently sliding the record out of its casing, placing it onto the record player, the hum of the motor beginning to turn, and hearing the warp as the needle hits drops. Dinner parties and hangouts have a certain jenosaiqua when envoloped in the warm static of physical music.</description>

      <description>Soda pop lover,
My sweet little treat
I love the days we spend lazing in your sheets
Savoring small sips of each other
It’s hard not to cave in for just one more
&amp;hellip; and another
I drown in your sparkling Carmel eyes
Your bubbly voice whispering in my ears
Your kiss tingles my insides with a delightful fizz
You fill my body and brain with happiness
Nothing could be better than this</description>
