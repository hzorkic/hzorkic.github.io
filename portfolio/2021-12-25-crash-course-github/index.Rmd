description: My earnest attempt to avoid all future frustrations with version control.
---

I love git and github. Throughout my projects, internships, classes, and research, I've used github to keep track of projects. 

## Why Git?
**Version Control**! Simply put, version control allows you to *keep track of changes* in code instead of saving dozens of copies of a project as you progress through it. Version control also allows you to seamlessly *merge changes* made by people working on a similar project as you. 

## Why Github?
Github is like a library for projects- you can see and checkout the works of others. Perhaps that is not a very good analogy as github allows for much much more than simply reading projects. Github is also like a social media network- you can make comments and suggest changes on other peoples projects!

## How to get started with Github.
- Get a github account
- Download and install git
- Set up git with your username and email
- [Set up ssh](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

## The basics
### Add and commit
Use git add to tell git "hey these changes are ready!"
The git add command adds entire new files:
```{} 
$ git add .
```
 ...as well as adds changes to specific/old files:  
```{} 
$ git add R/modified.R man/modified.Rd 
```

Use git commit to add the changes to the git repository. add a message (`-m` "message"):
```{} 
$ git commit -m "A message for your commit"
```

### Push your changes to github!!!
To push your committed changes to github:
```{} 
$ git push
```

## Start a new git repository
### Create a completely new, empty repo
- Create a directory to contain the project.
- Go into the new directory.
- Type `git init`.
- Write some code.
- Type `git add` to add the files (see the typical use page).
- Type `git commit`.

### Create a new repo from an old project
In other words, how to start tracking an old project. 

- Go into the directory containing the project.
- Type `git init`.
- Type `git add .` to add all of the relevant files.
- Type `git commit`.

### Connect your repo (old or new) to github
- Go to github.
- Log in to your account.
- Click the new repository button in the top-right. 
- Click the “Create repository” button.



## Tips and Notes for personal use!
### How to properly use SSH
When you reference a repo in git commands, use `git@github.com:username/new_repo` NOT `https://github.com/username/new_repo`. The former uses SSH, the latter forces you to login with your username, password, and now tokens key. 

### How to check the git repo attached in a directory
```{}
$ git config -l
```

### How to "blow away all git-related information" in a directory
```{}
$ rm -rf .git
```
