      <description>Donâ€™t look into the sun
They tell you as a child
But itâ€™s so hard not to
When consequences seem mild
I stare up at through the oak tree
A fluttering filter to the sky
Every once in a while a leaf moves
And then sun burns my eyes
I do not panic
I do not look away
For in less than a second
a leaf guards my gaze
Whatâ€™s left is a pulsing blue dot</description>

      <description>Using Neural Style Transfer for R.F. Alvarez Paintings.
Project Summary:  Have you heard of DALLE? Not the artist&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; not exactly not an artist, but the AI model from OpenAI?
For those of you unfamiliar with the artist reference, Salvador DalÃ­ was a mustached man who painted melting clocks and had a knack for turning everyday objects into surreal works of art. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know about the AI model, DALLÂ·E is an AI model that can create any image you may dream based only on the words you give it- sorta like an artist on demand.</description>

      <description>Are your virtual experiences
creating simulated realities?
 Could you tell them apart from actuality?
 Are your virtual realities
creating simulated experiences?
 And if that is the case,
when does it become deleterious ?
 Could you explain, to me, the difference?
 I think the line is blurring for me.
I think the line is blurring me.

      <description>Tell me why you like blue eyes.
When you stare, who do you see?
Because when you look into my eyes.
I know you&amp;rsquo;re not looking at me.

 To be fair, I like brown eyes.
For reasons assumed the same.
Because when I look into your eyes,
All I can think of is their name.

      <guid>https://hzorkic.github.io/creative/2023-09-11-my-tiny-record-player/</guid>
      <description>Background All my friends have record players- their homes are full of warm analog music and dusty wooden crates full of vinyl records. I love the ritual of sifting through the fraying sleeves, gently sliding the record out of its casing, placing it onto the record player, the hum of the motor beginning to turn, and hearing the warp as the needle hits drops. Dinner parties and hangouts have a certain jenosaiqua when envoloped in the warm static of physical music.</description>

      <description>Soda pop lover,
My sweet little treat
I love the days we spend lazing in your sheets
Savoring small sips of each other
Itâ€™s hard not to cave in for just one more
&amp;hellip; and another
I drown in your sparkling Carmel eyes
Your bubbly voice whispering in my ears
Your kiss tingles my insides with a delightful fizz
You fill my body and brain with happiness
Nothing could be better than this</description>

      <description>1. Introduction While pharmaceutical birth control continues to be the most popular method of contraceptive in the United States, the proliferation of different formulations of these methods can make decisions regarding which to use difficult for individual persons (Kavanaugh &amp;amp; Jerman, 2018). Additionally, research has shown that there may be a tendency for providers to diminish or avoid disclosing adverse side effects of contraceptives, further hindering a comprehensive understanding of its efficacy (Stevens, 2018).</description>

      <description>Introduction In my final semester of college, I had already completed all my course requirements, so I had the opportunity to enroll in some fun classes. I enrolled in Startitical Learning, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Regression Analysis, and Introduction to Yoga. Can you choose the item that doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong in this list? If you chose Yoga, you&amp;rsquo;re technically correct, however, I decided to merge my knowledge of Machine Learning and love for Yoga for my final project to creatively represent what Yoga means to me.</description>

      <description>What is ANOVA? ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) falls under a category of techniques called inferential statistics which allow you to test hypotheses or assess if Analysis of Variance your sample is generalizablbe to a broader population. A one-way ANOVA is a technique that extends the independent two-sample t-test to multiple groups, enabling users to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between group population means.
 Why ANOVA? Say, for example, we want to find out which pre-workout snack lead to different mean mile times.</description>

      <description>For this week&amp;rsquo;s homework we are going explore one new classification technique:
 Naive Bayes  In this post we are going to use a dataset of Melboburne housing to predict the housing type as one of three possible categories:
 &amp;lsquo;h&amp;rsquo; house &amp;lsquo;u&amp;rsquo; duplex &amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; townhouse  In addition to building our own Naive Bayes classifier, we are going to compare the performace of our classifier to the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier available in the scikit-learn library.</description>

      <description>Analysis of RNASeq Data from Wild Type and Mutated Arabidopsis thaliana 0. Background In this report, we are primarily interested in understanding how the differences in gene expression between the light and dark conditions vary by gene in the primary gene ontology id GO:0006090. To this end, we will use DESeq to look for genes with significant interaction terms between genotype and timepoint.
In interpreting the RNA-seq data set, you should note the following descriptions of the different sample genotypes:</description>
